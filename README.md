# Machine-Learning-Regression-Models

Regression models in machine learning are used to predict continuous numerical outcomes based on input features.

# 1.Linear Regression:
Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used regression techniques.
It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

# 2.Polynomial Regression:
Polynomial regression is an extension of linear regression that allows for the modeling of non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables.
It fits a polynomial function to the data instead of a straight line.

# 3.Decision Tree Regression:
Decision tree regression models the relationship between the independent and dependent variables using a tree-like structure.
It recursively partitions the feature space into regions and predicts the average of the dependent variable in each region.

# 4.Random Forest Regression:
Random forest regression is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision tree regressors.
It improves upon the performance of decision trees by reducing overfitting and increasing prediction accuracy.

These are just a few examples of regression models commonly used in machine learning.
It's often beneficial to experiment with multiple models and evaluate their performance to determine the best approach for a specific regression task.
